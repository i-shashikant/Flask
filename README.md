# Flask Web Application 🚀

This repository contains my learning journey of building web applications using **Flask**, a lightweight and powerful Python web framework. The goal is to understand the fundamentals of backend development, routing, templates, and deployment.

## 📌 Features
- Simple and minimal Flask setup
- Basic routing (`/`, `/login`, etc.)
- HTML templates with Jinja2
- Static file handling (CSS, JS, images)
- Ready for extension into larger projects

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/i-shashikant/flask.git
   cd flask
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
